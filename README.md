## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emiliano and I'm a developer living in Argentina.
I'm a frontend && fullstack dev and like graphics programming a lot.

### Currently working on:
- [Personal page](https://carmon.dev/), made in nextjs deployed over vercel, as most of my repos.
- Personal blog, named [til](https://github.com/carmon/til), it's a node app that generates a [static blog](https://til.vercel.app/), currently developing it with [til-utils](https://github.com/carmon/til-utils), a Github Oauth App, and [til-github-app](https://github.com/carmon/til-github-app), a Github App. The first one aims to create a new blog repo from a template (see [til-template](https://github.com/carmon/til-template)) and the second one is the bot manager of the created blog repository.
- [jmod](https://github.com/carmon/jmod), a JSON -> HTML form library, currently doing it while [streaming](https://www.twitch.tv/fromplayaunion).
- [textarea-ui](https://github.com/carmon/textarea-ui), a little experiment with textareas to build the UI for my new personal page.
- [ht-utils](https://github.com/carmon/ht-utils), if you play [Hattrick](https://hattrick.org), you may need this for looking your next season League.
