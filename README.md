### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emiliano and I'm a developer living in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
I'm a frontend && fullstack dev and like graphics programming a lot.

Currently working on:
- [textarea-ui](https://github.com/carmon/textarea-ui), a little experiment with textareas to build the UI for my new personal page.
- [rifles](https://github.com/carmon/rifles), a public exploring-roguelike videogame.

Some personal shortcuts:
- [TS boilerplate](https://github.com/carmon/boiler-ts)
- [JS fullstack boilerplate](https://github.com/carmon/boiler-fullstack-js)
