## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emiliano and I'm a developer living in Argentina.
I'm a frontend && fullstack dev and like graphics programming a lot.

### Currently working on:
- Personal blog, named [til](https://github.com/carmon/til), it's a node app that generates a [static blog](https://til.vercel.app/), currently developing it with [til-utils](https://github.com/carmon/til-utils), a github application that aims to turn any github repository into a blog.
- [jmod](https://github.com/carmon/jmod), a JSON -> HTML form library, currently doing it while [streaming](https://www.twitch.tv/carmontv).
- [textarea-ui](https://github.com/carmon/textarea-ui), a little experiment with textareas to build the UI for my new personal page.
- [rifles](https://github.com/carmon/rifles), a public exploring-roguelike videogame.
- [ht-utils](https://github.com/carmon/ht-utils), if you play [Hattrick](https://hattrick.org), you may need this.

#### Personal shortcuts:
- [TS boilerplate](https://github.com/carmon/boiler-ts)
- [JS fullstack boilerplate](https://github.com/carmon/boiler-fullstack-js)
